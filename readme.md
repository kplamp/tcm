# TCM

Description: This project is designed as a light-weight test case management tool.  

With TCM, users can create test plans, export them in (eventually) a variety of formats for other usages (such as email, code reviews, committing to the project, etc.).

Users can (eventually) also re-load the exported test plan and execute the test plan, keeping track of the number of executions as well as pass/fail ratio.
